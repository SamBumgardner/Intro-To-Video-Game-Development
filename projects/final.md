# CSC 303 - Spring 2022 - Final Project

## Purpose
The result of this project represents everything we've learned in the class. By creating a game 
start-to-finish, we demonstrate the kind of competency that we set out to achieve in the first 
place - the ability to apply the programming knowledge we already have to the process of making a 
game.

It also gives an opportunity to flex those creative design muscles that (while not something we
focus on teaching in this class) are a big part of the game-making process.

## Due Dates
This project is worth a hefty 30% of the class's total grade. As in our midterm project, we'll 
use a system of checkpoint meetings prevent procrastination and reduce end-of-semester stress. 
We'll use each meeting to discuss your progress and re-assess our initial goals.

## Objective
Fully implement a game of your own design.

## Project Setup
The entire project should be managed in a Git repository. 

To help you get started:
 1. Create your own repository for the game on GitHub.
 2. Set up branch protection for the project's `main` branch.
 3. Choose an appropriate license and add it to the repository.
 4. Create and populate a .gitignore file to avoid committing build results or IDE files.
 5. Using your engine of choice, add the basic project template to your repository directory.

## Specifications
 * The project must be built using HaxeFlixel or Godot.
 * The project's repository must have a README which includes an overview, how-to-play instructions,
   and a screenshot of the game.
 * The project's repository must either link to an online demo of the game or provide a downloadable
   release with instructions to set up for local play.
 * The game must accept some sort of input from the player.
 * The game must have a goal.

Keep in mind that while the specifications are lenient, the value you get out of this project will
be proportional to the time and effort you invest in it.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able 
to talk through whatever's scaring you.
