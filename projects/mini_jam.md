# CSC 303 - Spring 2023 - Mini Jam

## Purpose
Though we've already made a small-scale game for this class, participating in a game jam is a very
different kind of experience. Working within the limitations of a single weekend, using the jam's 
theme for inspiration, teaming up with others - these all add up to a unique kind of environment
that we can learn a lot from.

The ideal result of this project is to have some small, functioning game by the end that can be 
shared (and ranked!) through [Mini Jam](https://minijamofficial.com/)! That said, I understand that the inflexibility of this 
assignment's schedule could be very inconvenient. **Should this specific weekend not work for you,**
**communicate with me ahead of time and we can run a make-up game jam at an alternative time.**

The real measure of success for this project is in having the experience of attempting a game jam 
regardless of the outcome.

## Due Dates
The project is worth 20% of your total grade, and it's included as a sort of frantic, real-world
test of everything we've learned so far. 

The project grade is split between the actual work of participating in the game jam and the
post-jam reflection. Originally the plan was to offload more of the grade from the jam itself
to reduce pressure, but the timing didn't end up working out in a favorable way to support it.

## Objective
Participate in [Mini Jam](https://minijamofficial.com/), and get some valuable real-world experience along the way.

## Specifications
### Project
 * Students may join the game jam in a team with other students or people outside of the class.
   The student's plan for selecting teammates (if applicable) must be outlined in the pre-game jam
   preparation write-up due before the game jam begins.
 * Students may use any programming language and game engine of their choosing to create their 
   submission to Mini Jam. Using tools learned in class is welcome but not required.
 * The finished game's code must be publically available somewhere, preferrably on Github alongside
   other class projects.
 * The submission to Mini Jam must follow 
   [Mini Jam's official rules](https://minijamofficial.com/rules)
 * Student's must create an itch.io page to host their entry. It must describe the game and provide
   links to the source code a way to play it. Something similar to 
   [this](https://nbumgardner.itch.io/ludum-dare-52) 
   would be fine.
 * The game must accept some sort of input from the player.
 * The game must have a goal.

### Reflection
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_jam_reflection.md` that answers the following 
questions:
 1. Do you consider your project a success? What went well, and what didn't?
 2. How closely did you follow your original plan? If applicable, why did you choose to 
   (or have to) deviate from your plan?
 3. What kinds of preparation (done before you started puting code in the project) was useful for 
   you? Did you have any prep that felt ineffective or wasted?
 4. Describe at least one thing that you plan on doing again for our next project.
 5. Describe at least one thing that you *DON'T* plan on doing again for our next project.
 6. Describe something new that you will try doing for our next project.
 7. What were some of the biggest differences between this game jam project and our midterm project?
    Do you prefer one style of project over the other?

To submit the reflection, attach it to an email sent 
to `Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu` with subject `CSC 303 Ludum Dare Reflection`.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able to talk through whatever's scaring you.
