# CSC 303 - Spring 2022 - Ludum Dare 50

## Purpose
Though we've already made a small-scale game for this class, participating in a game jam is a very
different kind of experience. Working within the limitations of a single weekend, using the jam's 
theme for inspiration, teaming up with others - these all add up to a unique kind of environment
that we can learn a lot from.

The ideal result of this project is to have some small, functioning game by the end that can be 
shared (and ranked!) through Ludum Dare! That said, I understand that the inflexibility of this 
assignment's schedule could be very inconvenient. **Should this specific weekend not work for you,**
**communicate with me ahead of time and we can run a mock game jam at an alternative time.**

The real measure of success for this project is in having the experience of attempting a game jam 
regardless of the outcome.

## Due Dates
The project is worth 20% of your total grade, and it's included as a sort of frantic, real-world
test of everything we've learned so far. 

The majority of the project grade is split between pre-game jam preparation and post-game jam 
reflection, however. This isn't to de-incentivize finishing a game, it's more of a concession to 
the fact that this is a pretty difficult thing for a 1-credit hour class to ask of you.

Assignment                            | Due Date            | Grade
------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------
Pre-game jam preparation write-up     | 3/27/2022 @ 5:30 PM | 30% of assignment grade
Completed game uploaded to Ludum Dare | 4/4/2022            | 20% of assignment grade
Post-game jam reflection write-up     | 4/6/2022            | 50% of assignment grade

## Objective
Participate in Ludum Dare 50, and get some valuable real-world experience along the way.

## Specifications
### Pre-game jam preparation write-up
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_LD_preparation.md` that answers the following 
questions:
 1. What is your Ludum Dare username? Please include a link to your profile page.
 2. Do you plan on working on a team? If so, who will you work with?
 3. What technology or tools are you planning on using for game development? This includes things
    like your game engine that you use for programming, but could also include tools for sound and
    art or repositories of royalty-free content that you plan on using to populate your game.
 4. How do you plan on using your time this weekend? Write up a rough schedule (at least day-by-day
    breakdown of how much you expect to get done) for use during the jam and for our review 
    afterward.

### Project
 * Students may join the game jam in a team with other students or people outside of the class.
   The student's plan for selecting teammates (if applicable) must be outlined in the pre-game jam
   preparation write-up due before the game jam begins.
 * Students may use any programming language and game engine of their choosing to create their 
   submission to LD 50. Using tools learned in class is welcome but not required.
 * The finished game's code must be publically available somewhere, preferrably on Github alongside
   other class projects.
 * The submission to LD 50 must follow 
   [Ludum Dare's official 'jam' rules](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules)
 * Student's must create a submission page for their entry that describes the game and provides
   links to the source code and game. Something like 
   [this submission page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/tug-of-warriors-local-2-player) 
   would be fine.
 * The game must accept some sort of input from the player.
 * The game must have a goal.

### Reflection
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_LD_reflection.md` that answers the following 
questions:
 1. Do you consider your project a success? What went well, and what didn't?
 2. How closely did you follow your original plan? If applicable, why did you choose to 
   (or have to) deviate from your plan?
 3. What kinds of preparation (done before you started puting code in the project) was useful for 
   you? Did you have any prep that felt ineffective or wasted?
 4. Describe at least one thing that you plan on doing again for our next project.
 5. Describe at least one thing that you *DON'T* plan on doing again for our next project.
 6. Describe something new that you will try doing for our next project.
 7. What were some of the biggest differences between this game jam project and our midterm project?
    Do you prefer one style of project over the other?

To submit the reflection, attach it to an email sent 
to `Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu` with subject `CSC 303 Ludum Dare Reflection`.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able to talk through whatever's scaring you.
