# Final Project Proposal

## Purpose
We're beginning the final project for the class soon, and doing some thinking before we begin is
a big part of making this go smoothly. It also helps me give early feedback about dangerous scope
or difficulties that may be difficult to anticipate.

Rather than bury this in the project description document where it's easily overlooked (the issue 
that undermined Ludum Dare pre-project prep plan) we'll have a nice, clean, separate document
to focus on for this part of the project.

## To Do List
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_final_project_proposal.md` that contains the 
following information:
 1. Name of the game
 2. Short description of gameplay
 3. List of games that are similar or serve as inspiration
 4. Win condition
 5. Lose condition
 6. How the player interacts with the game
 7. The game engine and other tools you plan to use to create the game.
 8. List of core features: 
    * These are things you **must** have for the game to be complete in a basic way.
    * You should have a clear idea of you think you should be able to implement these, or have a 
      plan for figuring them out / asking for help about them early in the project.
 9. List of secondary features: 
    * These are things that are still important, but not as critical enough to be 'core'.
    * It's best if you have a rough idea of how these would work as well, but you can get away with
      them being a bit less well-defined - if they fall through, you still have your core game intact.
 10. List of bonus features: 
     * These are things that would be nice to have, but are definitely non-essential. After 'core' 
       and 'secondary' features are complete, these take priority.
 11. Realistic goals/expectations for the ~4 weeks of work on the project

If some kind of visual aid would assist in explaining your game concept, feel free to draw some 
pictures to attach to the email submission - reference them where it's useful and I'll get the idea.

## Due Date 
Monday, 4/17/2023 @ 5:30 PM 

## Submission Instructions
Send an email with your `<insert_your_name>_final_project_proposal.md` file attached to 
bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

## Grading Criteria
Sending in the proposal via email by the due date is all that's needed for a full 10/10 score.

I'll request revisions and resubmission if there are any issues with the initial proposal, no grade
penalty attached. If your submission is late I also won't impose a penalty, you'll just lose project
work time figuring this out in-class.

Games generally don't spring from the mind fully-formed, taking your time to think this over (maybe
complete it early and review it once or twice before submitting) will help you start this project 
with a robust plan that's more likely to lead to success.
