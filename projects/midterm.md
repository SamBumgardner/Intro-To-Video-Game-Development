# CSC 303 - Spring 2022 - Haxeflixel Midterm Project

## Purpose
We've been set back a bit by snow days, so we're going to deviate from our original plan for making 
a full game in Haxeflixel for our midterm project. Instead we'll get a miniature version of the 
whole experience by collaboratively adding feature's to the newly made 
[csc-303-game-2022](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/csc-303-game-2022) repository

## Due Dates
This project is worth 20% of the class's total grade and our work time is stretched across several
weeks. The scale of this project isn't too large, but we still have some staggered due dates to
help keep everyone on-rails for our first real self-guided work.

## Objective
Propose, design and implement an interesting feature for the shared class game in the 
[csc-303-game-2022](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/csc-303-game-2022) repository.

## Project Setup
Use the fork-and-branch strategy we discussed earlier in the class to prepare your contribution to
our shared project.

If you need a refresher on how the whole process works, I recommend reviewing our git-related 
resources:
 * [git cheat sheet](../lectures/git/git_cheat_sheet.md)
 * [git fork syncing guide (with pictures)](../lectures/git/git_fork_syncing.md)
 * [2-3: Fork-and-Branch Contribution with Git](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kDT7THm1McMEHkb7dtivV_1u5yDohQHhODZqOeO9hsY/edit?usp=sharing)

## Specifications
Here's the list of general requirements for the project:
1. The new feature you create should result in a noticeable change in the game.

Yeah, that's it.

Keep in mind that while the strict requirements for this assignment are lenient, the value you get 
out of this project will be proportional to the time and effort you invest in it.

### Project Proposal
Your project proposal doesn't need to be a particularly formal document, but please make sure you
include the following information in some kind of text file:

 1. Short description of the planned features
 2. Feature branch name(s) (if you plan on making multiple features, we'll want separate branches 
 for each).
 3. List of existing classes you expect to update
 4. List of new classes you expect to create
   * For each new class, specify what parent class you think it should inherit from
 5. (Optional) Write out additional details of your implementation.
   * Anything you put down in words here is something that we can discuss before you get started. 
   Getting early feedback on the design means we both can have an easier path through this project.
 6. Short discussion of how this new content will interact with or build off of existing content.

To submit the proposal, attach the file you created to an email and send it to 
`Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu` with subject `CSC 303 Midterm Proposal`.

### Contribution & Pull Request
Please use these specifications to guide your work as you prepare your changes for review:
 1. The branch made in your forked repository should be named in a way that describes the feature 
 that you plan to implement.
 2. The pull request to the game's main repository must list and explain the changes made to the game.
 3. The pull request to the game's main repository must include at least 1 screenshot.

### Reflection
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_midterm_reflection.md` that answers the following 
questions:
 1. Do you consider your work on the project a success? What went well, and what didn't?
 2. How closely did you follow your original proposal? If applicable, why did you choose to 
   (or have to) deviate from your plan?
 3. What kinds of preparation (done before you started puting code in the project) was useful for 
   you? Did you have any prep that felt ineffective or wasted?
 4. Describe at least one thing that you plan to do again in a future self-guided project.
 5. Describe at least one thing that you *DON'T* plan on doing again in a future self-guided project.
 6. Describe something new that you will try doing in our next project.
 7. Did you encounter any difficulties with using Git for version control during this project? 

To submit the reflection, attach it to an email sent 
to `Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu` with subject `CSC 303 Midterm Reflection`.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able 
to talk through whatever's scaring you.
