# CSC 303 - Spring 2022 - Haxeflixel Midterm Project

## Purpose
This project marks our first foray into the realm of start-to-finish game development! Expect it 
to be a bit messy and fraught with unexpected complications - there's plenty you'll learn by 
doing that's difficult to capture theoretically.

Our goal isn't really to make the best game ever. For this project, we want to make something small 
(and hopefully fun!) that lets us test what we've learned so far.

## Due Dates
This project is worth 20% of the class's total grade and our work time is stretched across several
weeks. To limit procrastination and make sure you don't end up in a crunch at the end, we'll hold 
weekly checkpoint meetings to discuss your progress and re-assess our initial goals.

## Objective
Fully implement a game of your own design.

## Project Setup
The entire project should be managed in a Git repository. 

To help you get started:
 1. Create your own repository for the game on GitHub.
 2. Set up branch protection for the project's `main` branch.
 3. Choose an appropriate license and add it to the repository.
 4. Create and populate a .gitignore file to avoid committing build results or IDE files.
 5. Use Haxeflixel to add the basic template to your repository: 
    `Haxelib run flixel tpl -n my_game`

## Specifications
### Project
 * The project must be built using HaxeFlixel.
 * The project's repository must have a README which includes an overview, how-to-play instructions,
   and a screenshot of the game.
 * The project's repository must either link to an online demo of the game or provide a downloadable
   release with instructions to set up for local play.
 * The game must accept some sort of input from the player.
 * The game must have a goal.

Keep in mind that while the specifications are lenient, the value you get out of this project will
be proportional to the time and effort you invest in it.

### Reflection
Create a markdown file named `<insert_your_name>_midterm_reflection.md` that answers the following 
questions:
 1. Do you consider your project a success? What went well, and what didn't?
 2. How closely did you follow your original proposal? If applicable, why did you choose to 
   (or have to) deviate from your plan?
 3. What kinds of preparation (done before you started puting code in the project) was useful for 
   you? Did you have any prep that felt ineffective or wasted?
 4. Describe at least one thing that you plan on doing again for our next project.
 5. Describe at least one thing that you *DON'T* plan on doing again for our next project.
 6. Describe something new that you will try doing for our next project.
 7. Did you encounter any difficulties with using Git for version control during this project? 

To submit the reflection, attach it to an email sent 
to `Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu` with subject `CSC 303 Midterm Reflection`.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able 
to talk through whatever's scaring you.
