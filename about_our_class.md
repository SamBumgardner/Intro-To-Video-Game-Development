# About Our Class
As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Victor Duchscherer
Hi, I'm Victor Duchscherer.

I enjoy playing video games, learning more coding, messing with art software, and watching anime sometimes.
Modding games is something I'm really passionate about, I'll mod just about any game I've played. I love customizing things.

I'm currently a CSC sophomore at MSU!
