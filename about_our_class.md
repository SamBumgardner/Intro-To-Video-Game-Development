# About Our Class
As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Sam McArthur, no examples here
Hello, I'm Sam McArthur. 
In my free time I play any manner of game, from board to video. I'm a junior software dev for O'Reilly and graduate this Semester, whoop. whoop.

## Sam Bumgardner
Hi, I'm Sam Bumgardner
I'm teaching this class, which means I get less sleep than I would otherwise.
I hope that we all enjoy a delicious dinner at some point in the next week.
 * My favorite kind of list is unordered.
 * I don't have anything in my pocket, Gollum would've gotten me
 * Inconsistency in putting periods at the end of list items always gets me.

 ## Victor Duchscherer
Hi, I'm Victor Duchscherer.
I enjoy playing video games, learning more coding, messing with art software, and watching anime sometimes.
Modding games is something I'm really passionate about, I'll mod just about any game I've played. I love customizing things.
* I'm currently a CSC sophomore at MSU!
