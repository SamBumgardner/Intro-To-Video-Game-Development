## Richard Peterson
Hello!  My name is Richard Peterson and I am a SUPER SENIOR!!  I am majoring in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Cyber Security, and a certificate in Web Programming.

I like to: 
 * Play video games (go figure).
 * Play the occasional table top game.
 * Watch TV and read the occasional sci-fi.
