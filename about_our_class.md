# About Our Class
As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

Sam Bumgardner:
 - I like cheese
 - I wish I was a fish
 - That was a rhyme ^

 Blake Engelbrecht:
 - This is an autobiography
 - written by me
 - posted on GitHub

 Matt Lippelman:
 - I also like cheese
 - but I like games more
 - I am terrible at rhymes
 
 Robert Chambers
 - I like Hamburgers
 - I like anime
 - I couldn't think of a rhyme
