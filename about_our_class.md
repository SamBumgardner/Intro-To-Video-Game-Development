# About Our Class

As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Example_Name
Hello, my name is Jesse. I did actually know how to tie my shoes before attending this University.

I'm a transfer student from the U of AR in Fayetteville. I am originally from Nixa, MO just south

of here, and I am a super senior.
