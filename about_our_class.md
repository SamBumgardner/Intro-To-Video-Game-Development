# About Our Class
As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Example Name
Hello, I'm Example Name. 
I like to go sailing on the weekends, but my true passion is collecting dryer lint.
 * I like making markdown lists, they're pretty cool.
 * Especially if my IDE supports previewing markdown (Visual Studio Code does)
 * If you're unfamiliar with Markdown, now's a great time to try things out!

## Sam Bumgardner
Hi, I'm Sam Bumgardner
I'm teaching this class, which means I get less sleep than I would otherwise.
I hope that we all enjoy a delicious dinner at some point in the next week.
 * My favorite kind of list is unordered.
 * I don't have anything in my pocket, Gollum would've gotten me
 * Inconsistency in putting periods at the end of list items always gets me.
