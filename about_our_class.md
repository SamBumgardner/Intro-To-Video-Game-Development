# About Our Class

As a class exercise, we will each use git and GitHub to add our own little autobiography to this file!

## Keith Cissell
Hello, I'm Keith Cissell, and I am studying computer science with a goal to aid space research 
and exploration. I am mostly interested in artificial intelegence and robotics. Idealy, I want to 
create a robot that is able to scout out planets / clusters to find resources and habitable areas.
