# Exercise: Exploring Game Programming Patterns
In this exercise, your task is to read about one of the programming patterns described in the 
online book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) and 
write up your own summary of the programming pattern it describes. We'll share our summaries 
with one another in-class on **Tuesday, April 6th** and discuss what we've learned.

## Purpose
Games can very quickly grow to be unmanagably complex pieces of code. Through this in-class 
exercise, we'll learn about different tricks and tactics (collectively known as "Programming 
Patterns" that can help us keep that complexity in check while satisfying the strict efficiency 
requirements that games demand. Hopefully, you'll get an idea of the benefits that (more) 
organized code brings to larger projects. 

The goals of this assignment are as follows:
 * Get exposure to the concept of programming patterns, and learn more deeply about a specific one.
   * This is raw acquisition of information.
 * Digest the information learned and relate it to real-world examples.
   * This helps you retain the information learned.
 * Present the information you've learned to others.
   * This cements your knowledge of the topic, and gives you the chance to learn from classmates!

## To Do List
 1. Select a pattern from [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) 
 to read and write about.
    * We'll do this in-class on **Tuesday, April 4th** 
 2. Read your selected chapter.
 3. Write a reflection / summary according to the requirements listed in **Deliverables**.
 4. Share the contents of your-write-up with the class.
    * We'll attempt to do this in-class on **Tuesday, April 6th**
 5. Turn in your write-up via email to bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu
 
## Deliverables 
Create a markdown file named `gpp_<insert_your_name>_<insert your_pattern_name>.md` that is broken 
up into sections that address the following points:

 1. Describe the pattern your chapter was about.
    * What kind of problem should this pattern help solve?
    * How does this pattern help solve the problem?
    * Make sure to describe it so that your classmates that haven't read the chapter can get a 
    high-level understanding of its purpose and general implementation strategy. 
 2. Consider a game that you would like to make in the future. Explain how this 
 pattern could be applied to some element of one of your own game ideas.
    * This may require some explaining of your game idea. Remember to not get 
    too carried away, and keep things focused on the programming pattern.
    * If you can't think of how the programming pattern would apply to a game you're interested in making, 
    feel free to just describe any (original, not taken directly from the book) hypothetical game 
    where the pattern would be useful.
 3. Share two (or more) features of real-world, already existing games where this pattern may have 
 been used. Some patterns are more generic (or harder to observe) than others, it's okay to make
 guesses without complete information.
    * Provide enough detail with your examples so it is an understandable and useful to 
    people who haven't played the game before.
    * Links to videos of gameplay and/or screenshots are not required, but may be useful to 
    give visual context to folks unfamilar with the game.
