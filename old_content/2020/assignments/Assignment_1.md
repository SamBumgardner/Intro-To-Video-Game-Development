# Assignment 1: Additional Git Practice

### To Do List:
 * Create a fork of my [CSC-303-Git-Playground](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/CSC-303-Git-Playground) repository.
 * Make at least three branches off of your fork's `master` branch.
 * Across all of your branches, make at least 10 commits, following the criteria below:
    1. At least three commits should include adding a file.
    2. At least three commits should include removing a file.
    3. At least three commits should include altering the contents of files.
 * Make a pull request from each of your branches to the original repository's `master`.
 * Review and comment on at least three other student's *unapproved* pull requests. Aim to leave a comment relevant to the contents of the pull request, rather than random memes.
 * Ask me to merge each of your pull requests. **HOWEVER** Before merging your pull requests, make sure to:
    1. Pull `master` into your branch if `master` has been updated since you originally branched off of it.
    2. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise in your branches.
 * Write up a response according to the instructions in **Deliverables** and email it to me.

### Deliverables: 

1 text file named `git_review.txt` that responds to the following questions:
 1. What did you do with Git during this assignment?
 2. Did you make any mistakes / encounter unexpected (or difficult) situations along the way?
 3. How did you deal with those situations?
 4. What pieces of knowledge are you missing (if any) that you would need to use git to manage and turn in future homework assignments?

The purpose of these questions isn't just to keep you busy; I want you to reflect upon and 
internalize lessons you learned while working through the assignment. I also want to hear what 
parts of Git you feel uncertain about (if any), so I can help you be properly prepared for the 
rest of your homework assignments.

### Submission Instructions: 
Send an email with your reflection attached to bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

**Due Date:** 3/30/2020 @ 5:30 PM (start of class)

**Grading Criteria**
Grading criteria is as follows:

 * Do all of the Git tasks: 7 pts.
 * Write up a thoughtful reflection: 3 pts.

1 point will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.
