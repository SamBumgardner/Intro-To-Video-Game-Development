# Assignment 3: Building Our Baseline Class Game
Note: This assigment is due **Wednesday, April 7th at 11:59 PM**.

This assignment is more freeform than previous ones. The requirements below are intentionally pretty bare-bones, and were written with the intent of allowing plenty of creativity. Have fun with this, and keep in mind that extra effort is rewarded with a deeper understanding of the material we've learned!

### Instructions
Using your own fork of our class's csc-303-game-2021 repository, implement features assigned to you in our 3/31/2021 lecture. We'll merge your work back into the main repository when we're done, so by the end of this we'll have a reasonably complete top-down zelda like game! 

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you complete this work:
 * Create a new branch for each feature you're implementing. Make sure the name of the branch reflects the work you're going to be doing in it.
 * At some point during your work (whenever you're ready for external folks to look at and help out with your code) open a pull request to merge your feature branch back to the original repository's `main` branch.
 * Aim to keep your changes limited to the classes that need updates for your feature. For example, temporarily adding objects in the `PlayState` class's `create()` method is fine for testing, but we'd rather not merge those changes back to main, given they're not what we want in that class long-term. 
 * Use the discord to notify others when your code's ready for review, or if you run into some problem and could use assistance.

### Assigned Features
Features were assigned to each student as follows:
 * Matt:
   *  Health system (heart containers) 
   *  Enemies that can move and damage the player
   *  boss battle 
 * Robert:
   * Keys + locked doors 
   * Ability to use items 
 * Blake:
   * Dungeon of connected rooms
   * Goal state
   * Starting state


### Turn-in Instructions
 * Make a pull request from each of your feature branches to the original csc-303-game-2021 repository's `main` branch. All of this should be done through GitHub. 
 * Send me a message when your pull request is ready to go, I'll review and give feedback before we merge.

**Due Date:**

This assigment is due **Wednesday, April 7th at 11:59 PM** (start of class).

I recommend that you start early and ask questions early. It's much easier to troubleshoot problems when we have days of time left before our due date.

**Grading Criteria:**

A totally correct assignment turned in by the due date will be worth a full 10 points (plus any bonus points earned). 1 point will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.
