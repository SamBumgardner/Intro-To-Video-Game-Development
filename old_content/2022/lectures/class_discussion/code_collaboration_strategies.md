# Food for Thought: Code Collaboration

## What are different ways that people can share and collaborate on code?
Brainstormed Ideas:
 - Taking turns on the same computer, like paired programming 
 - Copy and paste code to one person who assembles 
 - Git 
 - Emailed 
 - Hand off physical code 
 - Video chat + shared screen. Either paired programming or worked on different modules, send 
   pieces together. 
 - Fileshare 

## What kinds of advantages and disadvantages apply to each solution?
Why pick one option over another?
 - Want to be able to decide on a strategy quickly, don't want to waste time figuring out how to 
   cooperate.
 - Want to be able to work separately for greater efficiency.
 - Want to be resilient to misfortune, if possible (computers blowing up, people getting sick, etc.)

We generalized the brainstormed ideas into three categories, each of which we discussed below.

### Paired Programming
Disadvantages:
 - Can't divide and conquer, not so efficient in that way

Advantages:
 - Good for helping a team member catch up (or explain tricky problems)
 - Good for ad-hoc teams, doesn't need much setup time.
 - Resilient against miscommunication

### Git / VCS systems
Disadvantages:
 - Navigating conflicts can be difficult, especially if everyone's not exactly on the same page
 - Learning curve can be problematic, especially when resolving conflicting repositories.

Advantages
 - Very simple to share files with others when conflicts don't occur
 - File history is kept around

### Manual Assembly
Disadvantages:
 - Files might not match very well. Style and structure could be problems. Takes extra time to 
   resolve, lots of communication in post.
 - Without clear testing, can have issues with inputs / outputs not matching up
 - Assuming only one person is putting it all together, there's a single point of failure for the 
   group - very vulnerable to misfortune.

Advantages:
 - Takes less active particpation (can divide and conquer effectively). 
 - Only one person has to assemble (for better or for worse)

## For Further Consideration
What personal experience (good or bad) have you had with different strategies during past group 
projects?

If you had to rank these strategies in order of personal preference for use on a project, how would
you order them? Why would you choose that order?
