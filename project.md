## Due Dates
The project is worth 40% of your total grade. Completing it is required. To prevent
procrastination and to assist with lowering end-of-semester stress, there are weekly checkpoints
along the way where you must communicate with me about your project's progress.

 * Checkpoint 1 - Project proposal (turn-in via email):                  4/21/2017 - 5% of assignment grade
 * Checkpoint 2 - Review progress, determine reasonable changes to goal: 4/28/2017 - 5% of assignment grade
 * Checkpoint 3 - Review progress, finalize end-goal for project:        5/5/2017  - 5% of assignment grade
 * Checkpoint 4 - Panic check, prepare for final presentation:           5/12/2017 - 5% of assignment grade
 * Final project turn-in and presentation:                               5/17/2017 - 75% of assignment grade

## Objective
There are two different options for this project:
 1. Implement a basic game of your choice. 
 2. Add a new feature or subsystem to the class's example game

## Project Setup
If you choose to create your own game:

The entire project should be created in a GIT repository. Create your own repository for the game on GitHub.

If you choose to extend our class's game:

Your work should be done on a fork of our game's main repository. Create a single "final-project" branch off of the fork to hold all 
of your changes. If you want to split your work into multiple feature branches, branch those off of your main development branch, then 
merge them back in when they are completed. 

When your work is done, you should be able to make a single pull request from your fork's "final-project" branch to the main repository
to merge in all of the changes you have made.

## Specifications
If you choose to create your own game:
 * The project's repository must have a README which includes an overview, how-to-play instructions, and a screenshot of the game.
 * The project's repository must link to an online demo of the game.
 * The game must accept some sort of input from the player.
 * The game must have a goal.

If you choose to extend our class's game:
 * The pull request to the game's main repository must list and explain the changes made to the game.
 * The pull request to the game's main repository must include at least 1 screenshot.
 * The new feature or subsytem should result in a noticeable change in the game.

## Tips for Success
 1. Commit often
 2. Plan out your overall design on paper first!
 3. Test early, test often.
 4. If you feel panicked, take a deep breath. Then send me an email, because we'll probably be able to talk through whatever's scaring you.
