# CSC 303 - Introductory Video Game Development for Designers and Programmers
## Course Policy Statement - Spring 2022

**Office:** No campus office  
**Email:** Bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu  
**Office Hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll work something out.  
**Course Web Site:** https://github.com/SamBumgardner/Intro-To-Video-Game-Development

### Course Description
Hands-on introduction to video game development, emphasizing the application of general computer 
science knowledge to the process of making video games.

### Lectures
Our first two weeks of class will be held online via Zoom from 5:30 PM to 6:20 PM.

Subsequent lectures may also be held online each Monday and Wednesday from 5:30 PM to 
6:20 PM, but the state of the schedule isn't entirely certain. 
I'd like to make this change for our safety, given the transmissability of Covid variants
like Omicron. The class is presently slated to be in-person throughout the semester, but I'll be 
discussing this with the students and our department to understand if we can make the transition to
online without hampering our ability to teach and learn.

Should we fully switch to online classes, a link to our first online meeting will be emailed to 
each student before class begins. Subsequent links will be posted in the class discord server as
needed, or can be emailed out upon request.

Attendance will be required as part of each student's grade, see [attendance](#Attendance) for 
details.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students should:

 1. Know and comfortably use git workflow through github.
 2. Understand how to use the the Haxe programming language, and be capable of identifying key 
    differences between it and languages they were previously familiar with.
 3. Understand the purpose and core responsibilities of a game engine.
 4. Be capable of comparing the differences in design and features of different game engines, and 
    understand how they impact the game development process.
 5. Understand how to apply existing computer science-related knowledge to the process of making 
    games.

### Textbooks
[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html), read the book 
online free of charge!

### Attendance
Attendance in the class will account for 10% of your grade. Some supplementary lecture notes and 
resources will be uploaded to the class repository, but discussions and in-class exercises are hard 
to capture in a document. Not attending class generally isn't good for your understanding of the 
material, so please plan on attending all lectures throughout the semester.

If you know you will have to miss a class in advance, then please let me know in an email and we'll 
work something out. 

If some terrible catastrophe caused you to miss a class, please also let me know in an email. My 
goal isn't to punish people for having bad luck; I just want to encourage everyone to give their 
best effort to get in the classroom or zoom meeting on a regular basis.

### Tentative Outline
Weeks 1-4:
 * Introduction to class
 * How to make Git (and GitHub) work for you!
 * What are the responsibilities of a game engine?
 * How to code in Haxe.
 * How to work with HaxeFlixel.

Weeks 4-8:
 * Discuss how to implement various game systems in Haxeflixel.
 * Discussing about other game engines, their features, and some of the details of their 
   implementation.
 * Complete the [midterm haxeflixel project](projects/midterm.md).

Weeks 8-12:
 * Begin game development with Godot.
 * Discuss broader game development topics, including project planning and cross-discipline 
   collaboration.
 * [Participate in Ludum Dare 50 as a class project](projects/ludum_dare.md) (April 1st - 4th).

Weeks 12-16:
 * [Final project](projects/final.md) development.

### Grading
Component                                    | Percentage
-------------------------------------------- | -------------------
Assignments and Exercises                    | 20% 
[Midterm Project](projects/midterm.md)       | 20%
[Ludum Dare Project](projects/ludum_dare.md) | 20%
[Final Project](projects/final.md)           | 30%
Attendance                                   | 10%

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

 * 90% and above is an A
 * 80% and above is a B
 * 70% and above is a C
 * 60% and above is a D
 * below 60% is an F

I don't expect there to be any grade-curving in this class, but I reserve the right to do so if I 
consider it necessary.

An “W” grade for this course cannot be assigned after the deadline in the 
[academic calendar](https://www.missouristate.edu/Registrar/2021-2022-academic-calendar.htm#spring),
April 18th, 2022.

#### Examinations
None!

#### Important Notes on Grading
 * The best way to improve your course grade is to submit assignments on time.
 * The best way to reduce your course grade is to not turn in assignments.
 * The due date will be given with each assignment. 
 * Late assignments will be penalized 10% for each calendar day after the due date.
 * All assignments and lab exercises may be completed using free software available by download.

Also, this class should be lots of fun. Your grade exists to reflect your engagement with the 
course, not give you some arbitrary numbers to stress out about. If your grade does become a source 
of fear or stress, please talk to me right away.

Grades will be tracked via Blackboard, 

### Virtual Classroom Etiquette 
There's a strong possibility that we will run lectures virtually at some point during this semster, 
at which point many of the ordinary rules for classroom ettiquitte don't really apply to us anymore.
To help ensure we have smooth, productive, and fun remote learning sessions, please follow the 
recommendations described by the **"Tips for Meeting Attendees"** section of this article from the 
University of Pittsburg, [Zoom Meetings: Etiquette and Best Practices](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/blog/zoom-tips).


### University Policies
As of this year, common university polices (including familiar topics like nondiscrimination, 
disability accomodation, academic integrity, and more) are maintained on the 
[University Syllabus Policy Statements](https://www.missouristate.edu/provost/bbsyllabus.htm)
page on MSU's website. Please review it at the start of our semester to stay informed on these 
topics.

To be absolutely clear, I take these polices very seriously - I consider creating a safe and
comfortable learning environment to be a fundamental requirement of my work. Keeping the policies
in the external location doesn't mean they're distant from our class in any way - it's just a
matter of keeping university policy up-to-date and consistent across all of our classes.
