### Course Description
Hands-on introduction to video game development, emphasizing the application of general computer science knowledge to the process of making video games.

### Lectures
Lectures will be held online (via Zoom) each Monday and Wednesday from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm. See [attendance](#Attendance).
A link to our first meeting will be emailed out before class - subsequent zoom links will be posted in the class discor

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students should:

 1. Know and comfortably use git workflow through github.
 2. Have a solid understanding of the Haxe programming language and the differences and similarities between it and the other programming languages.
 3. Understand the purpose of a game engine.
 4. Be able to identify core responsibilities of a game engine.
 5. Understand how to apply existing computer science-related knowledge to the process of making games.

### Textbooks
[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html), read the book online free of charge!

### Attendance
Attendance in the class will account for 10% of your grade. I'll try to put all of our lecture notes into the class repository, but discussions and in-class exercises are hard to capture in a document. That, and not attending class generally isn't good for your students' understanding of the material. 

If you know you will have to miss a class in advance, then please let me know in an email and we'll work something out. 

If some terrible catastrophe caused you to miss a class, please also let me know in an email. My goal isn't to punish people for having bad luck; I just want to encourage everyone to give their best effort to get in the ~~classroom~~ zoom meeting on a regular basis.

### Tentative Outline
Weeks 1-4:
 * Introduction to class
 * How to make Git (and GitHub) work for you!
 * What are the responsibilities of a game engine?
 * How to code in Haxe.
 * How to work with HaxeFlixel.

Weeks 4-8:
 * Discuss how to implement various game systems.
 * Talk about other game engines, their features, and some of the implementation details behind them.
 * Work on [final project](project.md)


### Grading

Component                  | Percentage
-------------------------- | -------------------
Assignments and Exercises  | 50% (Drop 1 lowest)
[Final Project](project.md)              |                 40%
Attendance                 |                 10%

Each student's lowest-grade assignment will be dropped from their final grade at the end of the semester. This policy is in place to give students some measure of protection against unexpected disasters, not to give everyone one "free" assignment. Every graded assignment was assigned for a very particular purpose, so I recommend that you do *not* just pick an assignment to skip.

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

 * 90% and above is an A
 * 80% and above is a B
 * 70% and above is a C
 * 60% and above is a D
 * below 60% is an F

I don't expect there to be any grade-curving in this class, but I reserve the right to do so if I consider it necessary.

An “W” grade for this course cannot be assigned after the [deadline in the academic calendar](https://calendar.missouristate.edu/event/102123/193160).

### Examinations
None.

### Important Notes on Grading
 * The best way to improve your course grade is to submit assignments on time.
 * The best way to reduce your course grade is to not turn in assignments.
 * The due date will be given with each assignment. 
 * Late assignments will be penalized 10% for each calendar day after the due date.
 * All assignments and lab exercises may be completed using ~~MSU-provided equipment and software or~~ software available by download.

Also, this class should be lots of fun. Your grade exists to reflect your engagement with the course, not give you some arbitrary numbers to stress out about. If your grade does become a source of fear or stress, please talk to me right away.

### "Classroom" Policies
We're all learning from home now, so most of the ordinary rules for classroom ettiquitte don't really apply to us anymore. To help ensure we have smooth, productive, and fun remote learning sessions, please follow the recommendations described by the "Tips for Meeting Attendees" section of this article from the University of Pittsburg, [Zoom Meetings: Etiquette and Best Practices](https://www.technology.pitt.edu/blog/zoom-tips)
