 1. Know and comfortably use Git workflow through Github.
 2. Understand how to use the Haxe programming language. 
 3. Identify significant differences and similarities between Haxe and other (previously-familiar) 
    programming languages.
 4. Understand the purpose and core responsibilities of a game engine.
 5. Be capable of comparing the differences in game engine designs and features; be comfortable 
    analyzing how each impacts the game development process.
 6. Be capable of creating games start-to-finish, applying prior computer science-related knowledge 
    to the entire process.

### Textbooks
*[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)* by Robert Nystrom. 
Available online, free of charge!

### Technology
#### Computer Requirements
For information on the basic computer requirements to be successful in any class, visit the 
[Knowledge Base for Computer Requirements](https://missouristate.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1931/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=107376) 
on the Missouri State University website.

Our specific class will have some more specialized technology requirements because we're heavily 
programming focused. That said, the technologies needed for this class were selected with the 
following criteria in mind:
 * Free
 * Broad OS / Environment compatibility
 * Low performance requirements
 * Open source
If you'd like to use a personal machine for class, we'll work through the process of installation 
and setup as we learn about each new tool. Otherwise, the computers in Cheek 210 and the Comp. Sci. 
lab in Cheek 213 will both have all of the necessary software needed to complete class assignments 
and projects.

#### Blackboard:
Blackboard will be used for our course as a secure way to track and communicate grading to all 
students. To be specific, you'll have access to view your grades through the My Grades link so you 
can stay up to date on how you are doing in the course. 

If you are unfamiliar with how to use Blackboard, I recommend reviewing the 
[Blackboard Basics for Students article](https://missouristate.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1931/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=15642)
on the Computer Services Knowledge Base. 

#### Github:
All course content will be made available to all students (and the wider world, I suppose) via the 
[Intro To Video Game Development Github Repository](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/Intro-To-Video-Game-Development). 
Assignments, Project specifications, lecture slides, resources, etc. will all be made available 
there.

Github will also be used for homework assignment submission and project management - all students
 will be expected to create and use a free Github account as part of their participation in the 
 class.

### Attendance
I strongly encourage participation and attendance in the class's normal lecture periods. It's not 
counted for any part of your grade, but gathering together in the classroom is typically the most 
effective and efficient way for us to learn - not just individually, but together. 

Questions and discussions shared with classmates provide value that can't be captured by a set of 
slides.

### Tentative Outline
Weeks 1-4:
 * Introduction to class
 * How to make Git (and GitHub) work for you!
 * What are the responsibilities of a game engine?
 * How to code in Haxe.
 * How to work with HaxeFlixel.

Weeks 4-8:
 * Discuss how to implement various game systems in Haxeflixel.
 * Discussing about other game engines, their features, and some of the details of their 
   implementation.
 * Complete the [midterm haxeflixel project](projects/midterm.md).

Weeks 8-12:
 * Begin game development with Godot.
 * Discuss broader game development topics, including project planning and cross-discipline 
   collaboration.
 * [Participate in Mini Jam as a class project](projects/mini_jam.md) (March 30th - April 2nd).

Weeks 12-16:
 * [Final project](projects/final.md) development.

### Grading
Component                                    | Percentage
-------------------------------------------- | -------------------
Assignments and Exercises                    | 20% 
[Midterm Project](projects/midterm.md)       | 25%
[Game Jam Project](projects/mini_jam.md)     | 25%
[Final Project](projects/final.md)           | 30%

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:

 * 90% and above is an A
 * 80% and above is a B
 * 70% and above is a C
 * 60% and above is a D
 * below 60% is an F

I don't expect there to be any grade-curving in this class, but I reserve the right to do so if I 
consider it necessary.

An “W” grade for this course cannot be assigned after the deadline in the 
[academic calendar](https://www.missouristate.edu/Registrar/2021-2022-academic-calendar.htm#spring),
April 18th, 2022.

#### Assignments and Exercises
A typical semester will involve 5-6 graded homework assignments and class exercises. Please note 
that assignments must be completed fully to receive any credit - an incomplete assignment will be 
returned with feedback for improvements. 

An assignment that is late will receive reduced credit: -10% per day late, to a minimum of 60%. An 
assignment that was returned with feedback will not be subject to this penalty, as long as an 
updated assignment is submitted for review within the next 72 hours.

This isn't intended as a way to inconvenience you - I've implemented it because a half-completed 
assignment usually misses the point. Homework exists as a way to engage with content outside of our 
scheduled hours, so our grading is structured to make sure we get value out of it instead of 
leaving it behind.

**Note:** If an assignment is late due to circumstances outside of your control, please communicate 
with me about it. Late penalties will be waived for sickness and personal or family emergencies. 
I also reserve the right to make our policy more flexible if the circumstances demand it. I will 
also strive to apply any exceptions to the late policy equally - any exception made for one student 
will be applied as widely as possible in the interest of fairness.

#### Projects
Projects in this class involve making a game. Grading on these projects will be split between 
evaluation of the final result (whether it meets the requirements outlined in the initial project 
assignment) and checkpoint meetings (which we'll use to keep larger scale projects on-track) 

The exact parameters of each project will vary, with the scope of our work getting wider with each 
subsequent project. Projects will have their own document that details objective, specifications, 
and submission instructions that I'll distribute when they're assigned. 

Here's a preview of what each project will entail:
 * Midterm Project: Collaborate with other students to implement features within a single shared 
   game.
 * Game Jam Project: Participate in a "game jam," creating a small-scale game in 72 hours. Work can 
   be completed alone or with a small team.
 * Final Project: Over the course of 4 weeks, create a full game from start to finish.

#### HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS COURSE:
To be successful in this course, I ask that you focus on these key things:
 * Maximize your participation and engagement! Learning's easier if we're excited about it - let 
   me know if you're having trouble sticking to the content and I'll do what I can to help.
 * Avoid getting disconnected from the class: concepts build on top of one another pretty 
   frequently - it can be difficult to recover after falling behind, let's work together to avoid 
   it.
 * The shared theme: Communication is key. If something comes up, big or small, I will do 
   whatever's in my power to help you. Just remember that our learning is collaborative - I can't 
   get started unless I know what's going on.

Also, remember that this class should be lots of fun. Your grade exists to reflect your engagement 
with the course and its content, not give you some arbitrary numbers to stress out about. If your 
grade does become a source of fear or stress, please talk to me right away.

### University Policies
Common university polices (including familiar topics like nondiscrimination, disability 
accomodation, academic integrity, and more) are maintained on the 
[University Syllabus Policy Statements](https://www.missouristate.edu/provost/bbsyllabus.htm)
page on MSU's website. Please review it at the start of our semester to stay informed on these 
topics.

To be absolutely clear, I take these polices very seriously - I consider creating a safe and
comfortable learning environment to be a fundamental requirement of my work. Keeping the policies
in the external location doesn't mean they're distant from our class in any way - it's just a
matter of keeping university policy up-to-date and consistent across all of our classes.
