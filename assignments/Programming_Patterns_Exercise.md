# In-Class Exercise: Exploring Game Programming Patterns
Games can very quickly grow to be unmanagably complex pieces of code. Through this in-class 
exercise, we'll learn about different tricks and tactics (collectively known as "Programming 
Patterns" that can help us keep that complexity in check while satisfying the strict efficiency 
requirements that games demand. Hopefully, you'll get an idea of the benefits that (more) 
organized code brings to larger projects. 

In this exercise, your task is to read about one of the programming patterns described in the 
online book [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) and 
write up your own condensed summary of the programming pattern described. During the second half
of class, we'll share our summaries with one another and discuss what we've learned.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:
 * Learn more deeply about a new programming pattern.
   * This is all about raw acquisition of information.
 * Digest the information learned and relate it to real-world examples.
   * This helps you retain the information learned.
 * Present the information you've learned to others.
   * This cements your knowledge of the topic, and gives you the chance to learn from classmates!

**To Do List:**

 * Select a pattern from [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) 
to read and write about.
 * Read your selected chapter.
 * Write a reflection / summary according to the requirements listed in **Deliverables**.
 * Share the contents of your-write-up with the class.
 * Turn in your write-up via email to bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu
 
**Deliverables:** 

1 text file named something like `<your_name_here>-<pattern_name_here>.txt` that 
is broken up into sections that address the following points:

 1. Describe the pattern your chapter was about.
    * Make sure to describe it so that your classmates that haven't read the chapter can get a 
high-level understanding of its purpose and general implementation strategy. 
 2. Everyone in this class has at least a few ideas for games they'd like to make someday, right? 
Explain how this pattern could be applied to some element of one of your own game ideas.
    * This may require some explaining of your game idea, which should be fun. Remember to not get 
too carried away, and keep things focused on the programming pattern overall.
    * If you can't think of how the programming pattern would apply to one of your future games, 
feel free to just describe any (original, not taken directly from the book) hypothetical game where 
the pattern would be useful.
 3. Show and discuss some (at least two) examples of elements of games where this pattern may have 
been used, or at least would have been useful in creating the end result we can see.
    * Give detail and depth with your examples so it is an understandable and useful example to 
people who haven't played the game before.
    * Links to videos of gameplay and/or screenshots are not required, but are definitely 
appreciated.
