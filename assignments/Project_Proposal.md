# Final Project Proposal

In this assignment, you will draft and submit the initial proposal for your final project. 

## Overview

You have two options for your final project:

 1. Create your own game using Haxe and the HaxeFlixel library.
 2. Select additional feature(s) to implement in an existing HaxeFlixel game.
    * [A Castlevania-type Platformer (2018)](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/csc-303-platformer-2018)
    * [A Mario-type Platformer (2017)](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/csc-303-platformer-2017)
    * Or a different project - consult with me if interested in some other option.

**Due Date:** 4/20/2018 @ 11:59 PM

**Deliverables:** 1 markdown file containing your project proposal, named `Project_Proposal.md`. See below for a list of expected content.

**Submission Instructions:** send an email with your proposal attached to bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

## Specific Requirements

**Expected Content (new game):**

 * Name of the game
 * Short description of gameplay
 * Win condition
 * Lose condition
 * How the player interacts with the game
 * List of game features (similar to the feature list we drafted for our platformer game)
 * Realistic goals/expectations for 3 weeks of work on the project
 * (Optional) Concept image for game
 
**Expected Content (additional features):**

 * Project you plan on improving
 * Feature branch name (should encompass the point of your overall features)
 * Short description of the planned feature(s)
 * List of classes you plan to implement
 * For each class, specify what parent class it inherits from
 * (Optional) Specify methods and properties for each class
 * Short discussion of how this new content will interact/build off of existing content
 
## Grading Criteria

Your grade for this assignment will be determined by completeness (including content for each of the non-optional requirements above) and thoroughness (having good, descriptive content in each category). If I find that your submission needs improving in either area, I'll allow you to make as many changes as you need to fix your proposal with no penalty to your grade.

However, you will lose points for the following:

 * A late initial turn-in (10% deduction per day)
 * Deciding to stop fixing your proposal before it is completely fixed

Hopefully neither of those end up being an issue for anyone! 

As always, send me an email if you have questions, comments, or concerns.
