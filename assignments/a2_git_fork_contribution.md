# Assignment 2: Using the GitHub Fork-and-Branch Contribution Strategy

## Purpose
Now that we've talked through how to use git in excruciating detail, it's time to demonstrate we're
ready to move on.

The point of this assignment is to:
 1. Give you hands-on experience following the fork-and-branch contribution strategy that's 
    standard practice for most open-source projects.
 2. Function as a practical test that you can navigate potentially tricky git situations yourself,
    or at least far enough to recognize when you need external help.

Also, quick note about the write-up at the end:

Most of our assignments won't involve a formal "write how this assignment went for you" bit at the
end, so don't worry if those aren't your cup of tea. If you do enjoy them, feel free to keep 
sending feedback my way throughout the semester. Understanding how well these assignments work for
you is a valuable thing for my consideration when preparing future assignments for our class.

Work through the to-do list and specifications below to complete the assignment.

## To Do List:
 1. Create a fork of the [CSC-303-Git-Playground](https://github.com/SamBumgardner/CSC-303-Git-Playground) 
   repository.
 2. Make at least three branches off of your fork's `master` branch.
 3. Across all of your branches, make at least 10 commits, following the criteria below:
    1. At least three commits should include adding a file.
    2. At least three commits should include removing a file.
    3. At least three commits should include altering the contents of files.
    4. The last commit can involve whatever you'd like. Be reasonably responsible!
 4. Make a pull request from each of your branches to the original repository's `master`.
 5. Review and comment on at least three other student's *unapproved* pull requests. 
   Aim to leave a comment relevant to the contents of the pull request, as practice for future 
   collaboration.
 6. Ask me to merge each of your pull requests, either via email or discord ping. 
   **HOWEVER** Before merging your pull requests, make sure to:
    1. Pull the original repository's `master` into your branch if it has been updated since you 
       originally branched off of it.
    2. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise in your branches.
 7. Write up a response according to the instructions in **Deliverables** and email it to me.

## Due Date 
TBD - After we finish relevant lecture content

## Deliverables 
Create a file named `<your_name>_a2_review.txt` that responds to the following questions:

 1. Did you make any mistakes or encounter unexpected / difficult situations along the way?
 2. How did you deal with those situations?
 3. What pieces of knowledge are you missing (if any) that you would need to use git to manage and 
    turn in future homework assignments?

### Submission Instructions
Send an email with your `<your_name>_a2_review.txt` file attached to 
bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

## Grading Criteria
Successfully merging each of your branches to the shared repository (containing the 10 commits 
specified above) is the first requirement for this assignment. 

Second is submitting the `<your_name>_a2_review.txt` file described above before the due date.

Complete both before the due date to earn a full 10 points for the assignment.

1 point will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.
