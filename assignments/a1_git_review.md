# Assignment 1: What do we already know about Git?

## Purpose
Everyone's coming into this class with different levels of experience and familiarity with Git. 

The point of this assignment is to:
 1. make sure our coding environment is set up to use Git
 2. give me an idea how comfortable each of you currently are with Git
 3. highlight any specific knowledge gaps we definitely want to address during class

To accomplish this, I've included basic instructions below to install git and have some short-answer
questions I'd like you to answer and send my way via email.

Work through the to-do list and specifications below to complete the assignment.

## To Do List:
 1. Set Up Git:
     - If Git isn't already installed on the computer you plan to use for class assignments, follow
     the appropriate steps outlined in [Github's Git Installation Guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
     to get it set up locally.

 2. Get a GitHub Account:
     - If you don't already have one, [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/signup)

 3. **(Optional)** Do a basic GitHub tutorial: 
     - If it's been a while since you've interacted with Git or GitHub, work through 
       [Github's "Hello World" tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)
       to refresh yourself on some of the basics.

 4. Answer Git-related questions:
     - Follow the instructions under `Deliverables` below to write up and send me your answers to 
     the git-related questions.

## Due Date 
Monday, 1/24/2021 @ 11:59 PM 

I'd be very happy if you could complete it before class, but I figured it'd be better to have some
extra wiggle room since the assignment was sent out Friday evening.

## Deliverables 
Create a file named `<your_name>_git_review.txt` that responds to the following questions:

 1. How would describe your comfort level with Git on a scale of 1 to 5?
    - `1` is "very uncomfortable, I wouldn't know where to start"  
    - `3` is "I can probably get by with some help, or could use it alone on a simple project"
    - `5` is "I think I understand how to use Git very effectively to improve my workflow in solo 
      or team projects"

 2. There's a lot of jargon around Git and how we use it. Based on your current understanding of 
    Git, how would you describe each of these things related to it? Just a sentence for each 
    (or a straightforward "I haven't heard of it") is fine.
    - Repository
    - Commit
    - Branch

 3. What's the difference between Git and GitHub?

 4. Are there any specific Git-related topics that you'd like to learn more about during this class?

### Submission Instructions
Send an email with your `<your_name>_git_review.txt` file attached to 
bumgardner125@live.missouristate.edu

## Grading Criteria
Submitting the `<your_name>_git_review.txt` file described above before the due date, with each 
question answered to the best of your ability is worth 10 points.

1 point will be deducted for each day that the assignment is late.

I won't verify that you've completed your Git / GitHub setup as part of this assignment's grade,
but it's going to be vital for in-class exercises and upcoming homework assignments. I trust that
if you encounter any difficulty during setup you'll contact me for help.
